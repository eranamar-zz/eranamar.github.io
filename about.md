# Which topics will be discussed in this blog?

We will discuss most of the times topics related to Complexity or Probability theory. Sometimes we will talk about Hypergraphs, cut-sparsifiers and other general stuff.


# What is the purpose of this blog?

We want to post short discussions that we found intresting about topics related to our research. Each post will be a stand-alon unit and mostly discuss one topic.

# What with this name "Theory Lunch"?

All the discussions in this blog was originated during our daily meeting for lunch, therefore the posts will be short and (hopefully) simple.

# How are the authors?

We are Master students from Weizmann Institute of Science working in several fields in computer science: Algorithms & Machine Learning. The writter of each post is usually NOT the one who present the talk that the post cover.
