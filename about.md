### Which topics will be discussed in this blog?

I will discuss most of the times topics related to Complexity, Probability theory, and Deep Learning. Sometimes I will talk about Hypergraphs, cut-sparsifiers and other computer science stuff. I am assuming that the reader has a background in math & computer science at an undergraduate level.


### What with this name "Theory Lunch"?
 
The idea to start with this blog came to me during one of my daily lunch meetings with friends. I figured that some of our discussions can be easily written as posts in a blog, so I started one :)

### The Technology

I am using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the files for the site, [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to serve them statically, and [KaTex](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) to render the math. There are some hacks that I am using to allow writing the drafts in [Lyx](https://www.lyx.org/AdditionalSoftware) you can contact me for more details.
