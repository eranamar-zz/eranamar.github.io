### Which topics will be discussed in this blog?

I will discuss most of the times topics related to Complexity, Probability theory and Deep Learning. Sometimes I will talk about Hypergraphs, cut-sparsifiers and other computer science stuff. I am assuming that the reader has background in math & computer science of an undergraduate level.


### What with this name "Theory Lunch"?
 
The idea to start with this blog came to me during one of my daily lunch meetings. I figured that some of our discussions can be easily written as posts in a blog, so I started one :)
