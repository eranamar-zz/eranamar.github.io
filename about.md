### Which topics will be discussed in this blog?

We will discuss most of the times topics related to Complexity or Probability theory. Sometimes we will talk about Hypergraphs, cut-sparsifiers and more general stuff.


### What is the purpose of this blog?

We want to post short discussions that we found intresting about topics related to our research. Each post will be a stand-alon unit and mostly discuss one topic.

### What with this name "Theory Lunch"?

All the discussions in this blog was originated during our daily meeting for lunch, therefore the posts will be short and (hopefully) simple. 

### Who are the authors?

We are Master students from [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/feinberg/academics/msc-program-outline) working in several fields of Computer Science. Note that the writter of a post (mentioned as the "author" of the post) is usually just the one who volunteer to write it and NOT the one who brought up or presented the topic during our lunch.
